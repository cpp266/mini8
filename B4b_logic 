Absolutely! I’ll give the most detailed, viva-friendly, step-by-step explanation for this PINNACLE Club Deletion Linked List program like I did for your previous input codes. I’ll assume you want everything line-by-line, concepts, examples, and potential viva questions, using the new names we discussed: Aarav, Nisha, Rohan, Kavya, Siddharth.

PINNACLE Club Program (Deletion Operations) – Detailed Explanation


---

1. Include and Using Statements

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

#include<iostream> → allows input (cin) and output (cout).

#include<string> → allows usage of string datatype for member names.

using namespace std; → avoids writing std:: before cout, cin, string.



---

2. Node Structure

struct node {
    int prn;
    string name;
    node* next;
};

prn → Unique ID for each member (like 101, 102, 103…).

name → Member’s name.

next → Pointer to the next node (helps in linked list navigation).


Example Node:

[101, Aarav, next -> 102 Nisha]


---

3. Temporary Pointers

node *temp,*temp1,*temp2;

temp → Used for traversing the list.

temp1 → Holds node to delete temporarily.

temp2 → Holds node after the one to delete (helps reconnect list).



---

4. Class Definition

class pinclub {
public:
    node *head,*tail,*nnode;
    pinclub() { head=tail=NULL; }

    void create();             
    void deletepresident();    
    void deletesecretary();    
    void deletemember();       
    void count();              
    void display();            
};

head → First node of the list (President usually).

tail → Last node of the list (Secretary usually).

nnode → New node pointer for adding members.

Functions:

Function	Purpose

create()	Add initial members
deletepresident()	Delete first member
deletesecretary()	Delete last member
deletemember()	Delete a member by name
count()	Count total members
display()	Show list of members




---

5. Create Members Function

void pinclub::create() {
    char m;
    do {
        nnode=new node;
        nnode->next=NULL;
        cout<<"Enter prn number: "; cin>>nnode->prn;
        cout<<"Enter name of user: "; cin>>nnode->name;
        if(head==NULL) head=tail=nnode;
        else { tail->next=nnode; tail=nnode; }
        cout<<"Do you want to continue(y or n): "; cin>>m;
    } while(m=='y');
    display();
}

Loop allows adding multiple members.

First member: becomes both head and tail.

Next members: added at end (tail->next = new node; tail = new node).

Example Input:


101 Aarav
102 Nisha
103 Rohan
104 Kavya
105 Siddharth

After this, linked list looks like:


[101,Aarav] -> [102,Nisha] -> [103,Rohan] -> [104,Kavya] -> [105,Siddharth] -> NULL
head = 101, tail = 105


---

6. Delete President (First Node)

void pinclub::deletepresident() {
    if(head!=NULL) {
        temp=head;
        head=temp->next;
        delete temp;
        display();
    }
}

Deletes first node in the list.

Update head to next node.

Example: Delete Aarav → new head: [102,Nisha].

Viva Concept: Deleting first node is O(1) operation.



---

7. Delete Secretary (Last Node)

void pinclub::deletesecretary() {
    if(head!=NULL && tail!=NULL) {
        temp=head;
        while(temp->next!=tail) temp=temp->next;
        delete tail;
        tail=temp;
        tail->next=NULL;
        display();
    }
}

Traverse list until second-last node (temp).

Delete tail.

Update tail to temp.

Example: Delete Siddharth → new tail [104,Kavya].

Viva Concept: Deleting last node requires O(n) traversal.



---

8. Delete Member by Name (Middle Node)

void pinclub::deletemember() {
    string key; 
    cout<<"Enter the member name to delete: "; cin>>key;
    temp=head;
    while(temp->next!=NULL && temp->next->name!=key) temp=temp->next;
    temp1=temp->next; temp2=temp1->next;
    delete temp1;
    temp->next=temp2;
    display();
}

Search for node with name key.

Update previous node (temp->next) to skip the deleted node.

Example: Delete Rohan → [102,Nisha] -> [104,Kavya].

Viva Concept: Deleting middle node requires O(n) traversal.



---

9. Count Members

void pinclub::count() {
    int c=0;
    temp=head;
    while(temp!=NULL) { c++; temp=temp->next; }
    cout<<"Total members in club are: "<<c;
}

Traverse list, increment counter until NULL.

Example Output: 2 members remaining.



---

10. Display Members

void pinclub::display() {
    temp=head;
    while(temp!=NULL) {
        cout<<temp->prn<<" "<<temp->name;
        temp=temp->next;
    }
}

Traverse from head to tail, print PRN and Name.

Example Output:


YOUR UPDATED CLUB DATA IS:
102 Nisha
104 Kavya

11. Main Function & Menu

int main() {
    pinclub l1;
    int choice;
    cout<<"Welcome to PINNACLE Club"<<endl;
    l1.create();

    do {
        cout<<"\n1. Delete President";
        cout<<"\n2. Delete Secretary";
        cout<<"\n3. Delete Member";
        cout<<"\n4. Count Members";
        cout<<"\n5. Display Members";
        cout<<"\n6. Exit";
        cout<<"\nEnter your choice: "; cin>>choice;
        switch(choice) {
            case 1: l1.deletepresident(); break;
            case 2: l1.deletesecretary(); break;
            case 3: l1.deletemember(); break;
            case 4: l1.count(); break;
            case 5: l1.display(); break;
            case 6: cout<<"Exiting..."; break;
            default: cout<<"Invalid choice!";
        }
    } while(choice!=6);

    return 0;
}

Menu allows multiple operations interactively.

Example Execution Flow with New Names:


Step	Action	List After Action

1	Create Members	[101,Aarav]->[102,Nisha]->[103,Rohan]->[104,Kavya]->[105,Siddharth]
2	Delete President	[102,Nisha]->[103,Rohan]->[104,Kavya]->[105,Siddharth]
3	Delete Secretary	[102,Nisha]->[103,Rohan]->[104,Kavya]
4	Delete Member Rohan	[102,Nisha]->[104,Kavya]
5	Count Members	2
6	Display Members	Nisha, Kavya

12. Viva Questions (Concepts)

1. Q: What is a linked list?
A: A linear data structure with nodes containing data and pointer to next node.


2. Q: How is head different from tail?
A: Head → first node, Tail → last node.


3. Q: How do you delete the first node?
A: Update head = head->next, delete old head.


4. Q: How do you delete the last node?
A: Traverse to second-last node, delete last node, update tail.


5. Q: How do you delete a member by name?
A: Traverse to previous node, skip the node to delete, free memory.


6. Q: What’s the time complexity of deletion?
A: First node → O(1), Last/middle node → O(n)


7. Q: What happens if list is empty and we delete?
A: Program checks if(head!=NULL), nothing is deleted.


8. Q: Why do we use dynamic memory (new node)?
A: So memory is allocated at runtime; allows flexible list size.


9. Q: Difference between head, tail, temp, nnode?
A: head → start, tail → end, temp → traversal, nnode → new node.

If you want, I can also prepare a clear visual diagram showing the linked list evolution with new names. This is super helpful for viva explanations.

Do you want me to do that?
