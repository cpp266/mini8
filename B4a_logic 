PINNACLE Club Program – Detailed Explanation


---

1️⃣ Program Overview

This program manages a club member list using a singly linked list.

Each member has a PRN number and name.

We can add general members, president, secretary, count total members, and display the member list.


Key Concepts:

Singly Linked List → Each node points to the next.

Head pointer → points to the first member.

Tail pointer → points to the last member.

Dynamic memory allocation → new nodes are created at runtime using new.



---

2️⃣ Include Libraries

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

#include<iostream> → for input/output (cin, cout).

#include<string> → to use string datatype for names.

using namespace std; → avoids std:: prefix.



---

3️⃣ Node Structure

struct node {
    int prn;
    string name;
    node* next;
};

Explanation:

prn → stores the unique PRN number of a member.

name → stores member's name.

next → pointer to the next node in the linked list.


Example:

Member: PRN=101, Name=Rudrani → Node contains these values and points to next member.



---

4️⃣ Pinclub Class

class pinclub {
public:
    node *head,*tail,*nnode;
    pinclub() { head=tail=NULL; }

    void create();           // Add members
    void insertion();        // Add president
    void insertionlast();    // Add secretary
    void count();            // Count members
    void display();          // Display members
};

Explanation:

head → first member.

tail → last member.

nnode → temporary node used for adding new members.

Constructor initializes head and tail as NULL (list empty initially).

Functions for creating list, inserting at start/end, counting, and displaying.



---

5️⃣ Create Members

void pinclub::create() {
    char m;
    do {
        nnode=new node;
        nnode->next=NULL;
        cout<<endl<<"Enter prn number: ";
        cin>>nnode->prn;
        cout<<endl<<"Enter name of user: ";
        cin>>nnode->name;
        if(head==NULL) head=tail=nnode;
        else { tail->next=nnode; tail=nnode; }
        cout<<endl<<"Do you want to continue(y or n): ";
        cin>>m;
    } while(m=='y');
    display();
}

Explanation:

1. Creates members dynamically using new node.


2. nnode->next=NULL → last node points to NULL.


3. Takes PRN and Name input.


4. If head is NULL, this is first member, so head & tail point to nnode.


5. Else, add to end using tail->next=nnode; tail=nnode.


6. Loops until user enters 'n'.


7. Calls display() to show current members.



Example Run:

Enter prn number: 101
Enter name of user: Rudrani
Do you want to continue(y or n): y
Enter prn number: 102
Enter name of user: Anushka
Do you want to continue(y or n): n

Linked List Now:

head -> [101, Rudrani] -> [102, Anushka] -> NULL
tail -> points to [102, Anushka]


---

6️⃣ Insert President

void pinclub::insertion() {
    nnode=new node;
    nnode->next=NULL;
    cout<<endl<<"Enter president name: ";
    cin>>nnode->name;
    cout<<endl<<"Enter prn of president: ";
    cin>>nnode->prn;
    nnode->next=head;
    head=nnode;
    display();
}

Explanation:

Creates new node for president.

Inserts at beginning of linked list (nnode->next=head; head=nnode).

President is always first in list.


Example:

Before: [101, Rudrani] -> [102, Anushka]

Add President PRN=100, Name=Shraddha →


head -> [100, Shraddha] -> [101, Rudrani] -> [102, Anushka] -> NULL


---

7️⃣ Insert Secretary

void pinclub::insertionlast() {
    nnode=new node;
    nnode->next=NULL;
    cout<<endl<<"Enter name of secretary : ";
    cin>>nnode->name;
    cout<<endl<<"Enter prn of secretary: ";
    cin>>nnode->prn;
    tail->next=nnode;
    tail=nnode;
    display();
}

Explanation:

Creates new node for secretary.

Inserts at end of list.

Updates tail to new node.


Example:

Before: [100, Shraddha] -> [101, Rudrani] -> [102, Anushka]

Add Secretary PRN=103, Name=Isha →


[100, Shraddha] -> [101, Rudrani] -> [102, Anushka] -> [103, Isha] -> NULL
tail -> points to [103, Isha]


---

8️⃣ Count Members

void pinclub::count() {
    int c=0;
    temp=head;
    while(temp!=NULL) { c++; temp=temp->next; }
    cout<<"\nTotal members in club are: "<<c<<endl;
}

Explanation:

Start from head, traverse list until NULL, count each node.

Prints total number of members.


Example:

Current list: [100, Shraddha] -> [101, Rudrani] -> [102, Anushka] -> [103, Isha]

Output: Total members in club are: 4



---

9️⃣ Display Members

void pinclub::display() {
    cout<<endl<<"YOUR UPDATED CLUB DATA IS: "<<endl;
    if(head==NULL) cout<<endl<<"Club is empty";
    else {
        cout<<"\nPRN NO.\t NAME"<<endl;
        temp=head;
        while(temp!=NULL) {
            cout<<endl<<temp->prn<<"    "<<temp->name;
            temp=temp->next;
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

Prints all members from head to tail.

Traverses linked list using temp.

Displays PRN and Name in tabular format.


Example Output:

YOUR UPDATED CLUB DATA IS: 

PRN NO.   NAME
100       Shraddha
101       Rudrani
102       Anushka
103       Isha

10️⃣ Main Function

int main() {
    pinclub l1;
    int choice;
    cout<<"\nWelcome to PINNACLE Club"<<endl;
    l1.create();

    do {
        cout<<"\n1. Insert President";
        cout<<"\n2. Insert Secretary";
        cout<<"\n3. Count Members";
        cout<<"\n4. Display Members";
        cout<<"\n5. Exit";
        cout<<"\nEnter your choice: ";
        cin>>choice;
        switch(choice) {
            case 1: l1.insertion(); break;
            case 2: l1.insertionlast(); break;
            case 3: l1.count(); break;
            case 4: l1.display(); break;
            case 5: cout<<"\nExiting..."; break;
            default: cout<<"\nInvalid choice!";
        }
    } while(choice!=5);

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

Creates PINNACLE club object l1.

Calls create() → to add initial members.

Menu-driven program:

1. Insert President → at beginning


2. Insert Secretary → at end


3. Count Members


4. Display Members


5. Exit program




Example Run:

Welcome to PINNACLE Club
Enter prn number: 101
Enter name of user: Rudrani
Do you want to continue(y or n): y
Enter prn number: 102
Enter name of user: Anushka
Do you want to continue(y or n): n

Menu:
1. Insert President
2. Insert Secretary
3. Count Members
4. Display Members
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter president name: Shraddha
Enter prn of president: 100

List updated with president at head.

11️⃣ Viva Questions and Answers

1. What is a linked list?

A dynamic data structure where each element (node) points to the next.



2. Why use head and tail?

head → first node

tail → last node (to quickly add at end)



3. Difference between inserting at start and end?

Start → new node points to head, head updated.

End → tail’s next points to new node, tail updated.



4. Why do we use dynamic memory (new) instead of array?

Number of members is unknown at compile-time.

Dynamic memory allows flexible size.



5. What will happen if list is empty and we display?

Program prints “Club is empty”.



6. Why do we traverse using temp?

To avoid losing head pointer while moving through the list.



7. Can we insert president and secretary without creating members?

Yes, the list can be empty; insertion will make them first/last node.

✅ This explanation covers line-by-line logic, concepts, examples, outputs, and viva questions. You can confidently explain all operations of linked list in this program.


---

If you want, I can also make a separate table showing the list after each operation visually, which is very helpful in viva to explain step-by-step.

Do you want me to make that too?
