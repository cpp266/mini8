Program Overview

This program sorts an array of student percentages in ascending order using Selection Sort and displays top 5 scores vertically.

Operations in this program:

1. Input number of students and percentages


2. Display original array


3. Sort array using Selection Sort


4. Show array after each pass with comparisons


5. Print top 5 scores vertically




---

Step 1: Header and namespace

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include<iostream> → allows using cin and cout for input/output.

using namespace std; → avoids writing std::cout every time.



---

Step 2: Main Function

int main()
{
    int n, i, j, pass;
    float S[20], temp;

n → number of students

i, j, pass → loop counters

S[20] → array to store percentages (maximum 20 students)

temp → temporary variable for swapping



---

Step 3: Input number of students and percentages

cout << "\nHow many students for Selection Sort? ";
cin >> n;

cout << "Enter percentage of students:\n";
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    cin >> S[i];
}

Ask user how many students

Input their percentages into array S


Example:

n = 6

S = [78.5, 90.2, 56.8, 88.4, 69.5, 92.3]



---

Step 4: Display original array

cout << "\nSelection Sort: ";
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    cout << S[i] << " ";
}
cout << endl;

Prints array before sorting


Output Example:

Selection Sort: 78.5 90.2 56.8 88.4 69.5 92.3

Step 5: Selection Sort Algorithm

for (pass = 0; pass < n - 1; pass++)
{
    int minI = pass;
    int comparisons = 0;

    for (j = pass + 1; j < n; j++)
    {
        comparisons++;
        if (S[j] < S[minI])
        {
            minI = j;
        }
    }

    if (minI != pass)
    {
        temp = S[pass];
        S[pass] = S[minI];
        S[minI] = temp;
    }

    cout << "Pass " << pass + 1 << " | Comparisons: " << comparisons << " | Array: ";
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cout << S[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

Explanation Line by Line

1. for (pass = 0; pass < n - 1; pass++)

Outer loop → goes through each pass to find the minimum element



2. int minI = pass;

Assume current position as minimum



3. int comparisons = 0;

Counts number of comparisons in this pass



4. Inner loop for (j = pass + 1; j < n; j++)

Compare S[j] with current minimum S[minI]



5. comparisons++;

Increment comparison count



6. if (S[j] < S[minI]) minI = j;

Update minI if a smaller element found



7. if (minI != pass)

Swap current element with minimum found



8. temp = S[pass]; S[pass] = S[minI]; S[minI] = temp;

Swap using temporary variable



9. Print array after each pass with comparisons



Step-by-step Example:

Initial: [78.5, 90.2, 56.8, 88.4, 69.5, 92.3]

Pass 1: find min = 56.8 → swap with 78.5

Array: [56.8, 90.2, 78.5, 88.4, 69.5, 92.3]
Comparisons: 5

Pass 2: find min = 69.5 → swap with 90.2

Array: [56.8, 69.5, 78.5, 88.4, 90.2, 92.3]
Comparisons: 4

Pass 3: 78.5 → already in place

Pass 4: 88.4 → already in place

Pass 5: 90.2 → already in place


Final sorted array: [56.8, 69.5, 78.5, 88.4, 90.2, 92.3]

Step 6: Display Top 5 Scores Vertically

cout << "\nTop 5 Scores:\n";
for (i = n - 1; i >= n - 5 && i >= 0; i--)
{
    cout << S[i] << endl;
}

Loop starts from largest element (S[n-1])

Prints top 5 scores vertically

i >= 0 ensures program works even if students < 5


Example Output:

Top 5 Scores:
92.3
90.2
88.4
78.5
69.5

Step 7: Program Output Example

Input:

Number of students: 6  
Percentages: 78.5 90.2 56.8 88.4 69.5 92.3  
Insert sorting...

Output:

Selection Sort: 78.5 90.2 56.8 88.4 69.5 92.3
Pass 1 | Comparisons: 5 | Array: 56.8 90.2 78.5 88.4 69.5 92.3
Pass 2 | Comparisons: 4 | Array: 56.8 69.5 78.5 88.4 90.2 92.3
Pass 3 | Comparisons: 3 | Array: 56.8 69.5 78.5 88.4 90.2 92.3
Pass 4 | Comparisons: 2 | Array: 56.8 69.5 78.5 88.4 90.2 92.3
Pass 5 | Comparisons: 1 | Array: 56.8 69.5 78.5 88.4 90.2 92.3

Top 5 Scores:
92.3
90.2
88.4
78.5
69.5

Step 8: Viva Questions

1. What is Selection Sort?

Sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element and puts it in correct position.



2. Time Complexity?

Best, Worst, Average → O(n²)



3. Space Complexity?

O(1) → in-place sorting



4. Why do we use pass?

Each pass places one element in its correct position



5. Difference between Selection Sort and Bubble Sort?

Selection Sort → selects min element and swaps once per pass

Bubble Sort → swaps adjacent elements repeatedly



6. Why count comparisons?

To analyze efficiency of the algorithm



7. How do you print top scores?

Sort array → print from largest element (S[n-1])



8. Can this program handle <5 students?

Yes, loop condition i >= 0 ensures no error
