Program Purpose

This program checks whether a student is present or absent using:

1. Linear Search → checks roll numbers one by one


2. Binary Search → checks after sorting the roll numbers



It also allows repeated searching using loops.


---

Step 1: Include Libraries

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

Explanation:

iostream → for input/output (cin, cout)

algorithm → for sort() function (needed for binary search)

using namespace std; → avoids writing std:: every time



---

Step 2: Declare Variables

int i, n, b;
int A[5];
char ch;

Explanation:

i → loop counter

n → number of students

b → roll number to search for (key)

A[5] → stores roll numbers of students (array of size 5)

ch → controls repeated searching loop



---

Step 3: Input Number of Students and Roll Numbers

cout << "How many students are present: ";
cin >> n;
cout << "Enter roll no of student: ";
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    cin >> A[i];
}

Explanation:

Input number of students present in the class (n)

Loop runs n times → stores roll numbers in array A


Example:

n = 4
Roll numbers: 101 103 102 105


---

Step 4: Display Roll Numbers

cout << "\nRoll numbers are: ";
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    cout << A[i] << " ";
}

Explanation:

Simply prints all roll numbers for confirmation


Output Example:

Roll numbers are: 101 103 102 105


---

Step 5: Linear Search (Check if Student is Present)

do
{
    cout << "\nEnter key roll no: ";
    cin >> b;
    int match = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (A[i] == b)
        {
            match = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (match == 1)
        cout << "Student is present\n";
    else
        cout << "Student is absent\n";
    cout << "Do you want to continue (y/n): ";
    cin >> ch;
} while (ch == 'y');

Explanation:

1. Ask user for a roll number (b)


2. match = 0 → initially assume student is absent


3. Loop through array:

If A[i] == b → found → set match = 1 and stop (break)



4. Print result: present or absent


5. Ask if user wants to search again (y/n)



Example:

Array: [101, 103, 102, 105]

Key: 102 → found → present

Key: 104 → not found → absent


Viva Tip: Linear search is simple but slow if n is large.


---

Step 6: Prepare for Binary Search

cout << "\nBinary Search\n";
sort(A, A + n);
cout << "Sorted roll numbers are: ";
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    cout << A[i] << " ";
}

Explanation:

Binary search requires sorted array

sort(A, A + n) → sorts array in ascending order

Display sorted roll numbers


Example:
Original: [101, 103, 102, 105] → Sorted: [101, 102, 103, 105]

Viva Tip: Binary search cannot work on unsorted arrays


---

Step 7: Binary Search Loop

int start = 0, end = n - 1, flag = 0, mid;
char a;
do
{
    cout << "\nEnter a key roll no for binary: ";
    cin >> b;
    start = 0;
    end = n - 1;
    flag = 0;
    while (start <= end)
    {
        mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if (A[mid] == b)
        {
            flag = 1;
            break;
        }
        else if (A[mid] < b)
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        else
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    if (flag == 1)
        cout << "Student is present (Binary Search)\n";
    else
        cout << "Student is absent (Binary Search)\n";
    cout << "Do you want to continue binary search (y/n): ";
    cin >> a;
} while (a == 'y');

Explanation:

1. start = 0, end = n-1 → initial search range


2. flag = 0 → assume student absent


3. while(start <= end) → check range:

mid = (start + end)/2 → middle element

If A[mid] == b → found → flag = 1 → break

If A[mid] < b → search right half → start = mid + 1

Else → search left half → end = mid - 1



4. Print present/absent


5. Ask if user wants to search again



Example:

Array: [101, 102, 103, 105]

Search 103:

start=0, end=3 → mid=1 → A[1]=102 < 103 → start=2

mid=2 → A[2]=103 → found → present



Viva Tip: Binary search is faster than linear search → complexity O(log n)


---

Step 8: End Program

return 0;

Explanation: Program ends successfully.


---

Step 9: Sample Output

How many students are present: 4
Enter roll no of student: 101 103 102 105

Roll numbers are: 101 103 102 105

Enter key roll no: 102
Student is present
Do you want to continue (y/n): y

Enter key roll no: 104
Student is absent
Do you want to continue (y/n): n

Binary Search
Sorted roll numbers are: 101 102 103 105

Enter a key roll no for binary: 103
Student is present (Binary Search)
Do you want to continue binary search (y/n): n

Step 10: Viva Questions

1. What is linear search?

Search element one by one until found → simple, works on unsorted data



2. What is binary search?

Search in sorted array → divide & conquer → faster



3. Why do we sort array before binary search?

Binary search only works on sorted arrays



4. Complexity:

Linear search → O(n)

Binary search → O(log n)



5. What is the role of mid in binary search?

Middle element → divide array into two halves



6. Can you continue searching multiple times?

Yes, using do-while loop



7. Difference between linear and binary search?

Linear → sequential → slower

Binary → sorted → faster

Step 11: Tips for Viva Full Marks

Draw array and show search step-by-step

Explain loop logic clearly

Explain why binary search is faster

Mention sorted array requirement

If you want, I can also draw a visual diagram showing both linear and binary search on one array step by step, which is super viva-friendly and full marks material.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
